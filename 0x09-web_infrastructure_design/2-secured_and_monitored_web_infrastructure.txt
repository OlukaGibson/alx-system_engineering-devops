Additions & Purpose:

3 Firewalls: One for each entry point (LB, servers, DB). Control access.

SSL Certificate: Enables HTTPS — encrypts data in transit.

Monitoring Clients: Use something like Sentry, Sumologic, or Prometheus.

Collect logs, QPS (Queries per second), memory, uptime, etc.

To monitor QPS: Enable access logging, configure monitoring agent to parse logs.

Security & Monitoring Issues:

SSL Termination at Load Balancer: If traffic isn’t encrypted to backend, it’s a risk.

Single MySQL (write-only): Still a SPOF.

All-in-one servers: No isolation = harder scaling, more security risk.
