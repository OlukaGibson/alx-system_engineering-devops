Additions & Purpose:

HAProxy Load Balancer: Distributes requests between 2 servers.

Algorithm: Round Robin (or Least Connections, etc.)

Active-Passive: One server can go down without total failure.

Redundant App Servers: Better performance, handles more users.

MySQL: Still one DB instance.

Database Insight:

A Primary-Replica setup (Master-Slave) is better:

Primary Node: Accepts writes and updates.

Replica Node(s): Read-only copies for load balancing.

Issues:

SPOF: The database and load balancer are still SPOFs.

Security: No HTTPS or firewall.

Monitoring: None, so issues may go unnoticed.
