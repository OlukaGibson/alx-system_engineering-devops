Components Explanation:

Server: A physical/virtual machine hosting all components.

Domain Name: Human-readable address (foobar.com) pointing to IP (8.8.8.8).

DNS Record: The www in www.foobar.com is an A record pointing to the server’s IP.

Web Server (Nginx): Handles HTTP requests and forwards them to the application server.

Application Server: Runs the app logic (e.g., Python, Node.js).

App Files: The actual backend code (e.g., Django, Flask).

Database (MySQL): Stores persistent data.

Communication: Happens over HTTP (and TCP/IP stack).

Issues:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure): One server fails = whole site down.

Downtime during deployment: Restarting web server interrupts service.

Scalability: Can’t handle high traffic on one server.
