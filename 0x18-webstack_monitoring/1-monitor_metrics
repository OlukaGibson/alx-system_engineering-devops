Two monitors were created in Datadog:

1. **Disk Reads per Second**
   - Metric: `system.io.r_s`
   - Condition: Above `100` for the last `5 minutes`.
   - Alert Type: Warning/Alert.

2. **Disk Writes per Second**
   - Metric: `system.io.w_s`
   - Condition: Above `100` for the last `5 minutes`.
   - Alert Type: Warning/Alert.

Both monitors were configured via the Datadog dashboard:
- Navigate to Monitors → New Monitor → Metric.
- Choose the metric and set threshold alerts.
